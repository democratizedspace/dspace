You'll commonly see me refer to various spaces as they relate to the game:

- Localspace
- Cyberspace
- Blockspace
- Meatspace

This is generally the order in which game mechanics will be introduced over time. Here's a brief explanation of each:

## Localspace

Game state that exists only on your local device (phone, computer, Samsung Smart Fridge, etc.). The game will use a combination of cookies and localStorage to store your game state. Cookies are opt-in, but without them, your progress won't be saved. Right now, game state storage is super rudimentary, but over time, it'll get more sophisticated, especially when it comes to making sure you don't accidentally lose your progress.

Of particular note is that part of the Quest roadmap is the ability to create and experiment with your own questlines, items, and mechanics, completely locally. This lets you test out game elements that you might submit for review so that other people can enjoy them too. Or you could just keep everything local if you want to build your own little universe. Up to you!

## Cyberspace

This basically just means cloud storage. Eventually, you'll be able to sync your game state across devices. This will also be opt-in.

## Blockspace

This, of course, refers to blockchains. The game will eventually have things like NFTs and cryptocurrencies, but the way I approach this will be fundamentally different from other web3 games.
