DSPACE is an incremental simulation game about resource management and space exploration. Learn skills, work on quests, and build your own presence in the solar system. 

**The game is still very much under development.** If you'd like to get involved in the creation of the game, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM) and say hello!

## Start with the basics

Learn skills related to space exploration and resource management. Be an early adopter of (virtual) futuristic tech. Find a career related to the manufacturing of rockets. Eventually, you can start building a presence in space.

## Gain momentum

Gain access to an existing launch provider or use your own rockets. Launch payloads into low Earth orbit. Create fuel depots. Explore the moon and beyond. Build your own space station.

## Research

Use in-situ resource utilization. Mine the moon for water and oxygen. Use the water and oxygen to produce rocket fuel. Use the rocket fuel to launch rockets. Use the rockets to launch more rockets.

## Make your own quests

Make them locally and then share them with the community. Each quest is reviewed by a human to ensure that it is not spammy or malicious. The quests will be soulbound ERC-721 (or ERC-1155?) tokens minted for free, minus gas fees. Ideally on an L2.

## Gradual decentralization

The goal is to start with a very simple game and go from there. The game will be open source and free to play, and I'll try to make it easily forkable. Gradually, web3 elements will be added to the game, and ownership of assets and resources within the game will be tokenized so that it can be traded on a secondary market. Any web3 elements will be optional, and the game will be playable without them. The game will be playable on desktop and mobile through a web browser.
