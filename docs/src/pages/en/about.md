DSPACE is an incremental simulation game about resource management and space exploration. In the game, you'll learn skills, work on quests, and build your own presence in the solar system. 

The game is designed to be easy to pick up and play, with a gradual learning curve that will let you get the hang of the mechanics at your own pace. Whether you're looking for a casual game to idle, or a more in-depth experience to really sink your teeth into, DSPACE is sure to have something for you.

**The game is still very much under development.** If youâ€™d like to get involved in the creation of the game, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM) and say hello!
