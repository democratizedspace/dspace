The mission is make it just as easy to live anywhere in the solar system as it is to move to another continent. By open sourcing as much as possible (within regulatory constraints), we can decrease the cost of launches and develop an efficient pipeline of transit to and from the various planets, moons, and space stations within our solar system.
