[This essay about hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) has had a profound impact on how I frame web3, software projects, and financial incentives, and while I summarize it below, I highly recommend reading it in full.

The ideas discussed therein are things that I've actually been mulling over for years, but I've never seen them articulated so clearly.

Here's a basic summary:

## Summary

Hyperstructures are a way to design a project, particularly a project involving smart contracts, that implement the following properties. They're:

- unstoppable
- free
- valuable
- expansive
- permissionless
- positive sum
- credibly neutral

## But what do these terms mean?

### Unstoppable

Basically, since they're implemented with smart contracts (e.g. on the Ethereum network), they can't be shut down by a government or corporation. The smart contract data is immutable (meaning, the contract address will always point to the same bytecode), and if bad actors attempt to sensor transactions involving them, there are mitigations at the social layer (e.g. social slashing, hard forks). This is especially salient given the 2022 Tornado Cash sanctions that had a chilling effect on the entire DeFi ecosystem.

If the full vision of DSPACE is realized, government actors may feel compelled to force the project to shut down, and while they may be partially successful (the frontend app could be blocked by web2 infrastructure providers), the smart contracts will continue to operate.

### Free
