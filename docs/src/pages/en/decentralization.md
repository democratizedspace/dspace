The goal is to start with a very simple game and go from there. The game will be open source and free to play, and I'll try to make it easily forkable. Gradually, web3 elements will be added to the game, and ownership of assets and resources within the game will be tokenized so that it can be traded on a secondary market. Any web3 elements will be optional, and the game will be playable without them. The game will be playable on desktop and mobile through a web browser.
