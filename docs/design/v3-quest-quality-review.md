# v3 quest quality review: manual QA signal vs newly added quest content

## Why this doc exists

The v3 QA checklist already has a quest-by-quest validation list in
`docs/qa/v3.md` §4.5. At the time of writing, only 16 quests are checked, while 221 remain unchecked.
Most unchecked quests are newly added in v3 (`docs/new-quests.md`) and deserve focused quality review
before release hardening.

This doc compares the checked quests against unchecked quests, identifies recurring anti-patterns
in lower-quality entries, and proposes concrete documentation improvements for both humans and LLM
agents authoring quests.

## Scope and method

- Source of checked/unchecked status: `docs/qa/v3.md` §4.5.
- Source of “new in v3” status: `docs/new-quests.md`.
- Source of content quality observations: quest JSON under
  `frontend/src/pages/quests/json/<tree>/<quest>.json`.

Interpretation rule for this document:

- “Checked quests” always means entries marked checked in `docs/qa/v3.md` §4.5.
- “New in v3” always means quests listed in `docs/new-quests.md`.

Quick quantitative scan (scripted locally):

- Scan run on **2026-02-16** at commit **`80eb7ce9dc11c30817089a511277fc29832026f2`**.
- Reproduction method: parse quest IDs from `docs/qa/v3.md` §4.5, intersect with `docs/new-quests.md`, then compute structural counts from corresponding quest JSON files.

- Checked quests: **16**
- Unchecked quests: **221**
- Checked quests that are new in v3: **15/16**
- Unchecked quests that are new in v3: **221/221**

Average structural complexity (dialogue graph only):

- Checked quests: **8.81 dialogue nodes**, **15.81 options**, **2.12 process options**,
  **3.19 gated options**, **2.19 quiz-like nodes**.
- Unchecked quests: **3.81 dialogue nodes**, **5.31 options**, **1.17 process options**,
  **1.95 gated options**, **~0 quiz-like nodes**.

## Manually validated quest set (from `docs/qa/v3.md` §4.5)

Checked quest IDs (16 total):

- `3dprinting/start`
- `composting/check-temperature`
- `composting/sift-compost`
- `composting/start`
- `composting/turn-pile`
- `hydroponics/basil`
- `hydroponics/nutrient-check`
- `sysadmin/basic-commands`
- `sysadmin/log-analysis`
- `sysadmin/resource-monitoring`
- `ubi/basicincome`
- `welcome/connect-github`
- `welcome/howtodoquests`
- `welcome/intro-inventory`
- `welcome/run-tests`
- `welcome/smart-plug-test`

Exemplars from the checked set (what they do well):

- `hydroponics/nutrient-check`: ties progress to concrete process + item gating, not just narration.
- `sysadmin/basic-commands`: includes interpretation checks that build operator literacy and recap.
- `composting/start`: combines setup/safety/science checkpoints with retry loops.
- `welcome/run-tests`: bridges player action to next-step workflow expectations.

Contrast with unchecked quests that are also listed as new in v3 (`docs/new-quests.md`):

- `astronomy/saturn-rings`: currently tends toward a thin shell (observe then finish) with little
  troubleshooting path.
- `devops/fail2ban`: lacks explicit staged verification artifacts for install/config/validate flow.
- `energy/dWatt-1e8`: accumulation-heavy target with limited strategic branching.
- `programming/web-server`: can finish without strong failure-mode handling or evidence artifacts.

## What the checked quests are doing better

Checked quests are not uniformly perfect, but they more often demonstrate:

1. **Interaction depth**
   - Multi-step progression with explicit setup, execution, and validation flow.
   - Example: `composting/start` walks through UX, materials, safety/science, and quiz retries.
2. **Mechanic grounding**
   - Uses DSPACE mechanics directly (processes on item pages, gated transitions, item proofs).
   - Example: `hydroponics/nutrient-check` uses multiple process steps plus item gates.
3. **Operator literacy / explainability**
   - Some quests teach reasoning rather than only requiring a single item threshold.
   - Example: `sysadmin/basic-commands` includes command interpretation and knowledge checks.
4. **Safety and reproducibility cues**
   - Better entries include concrete safety behavior and realistic sequencing.

## Common anti-patterns in unchecked quests (especially new in v3)

1. **Three-node “thin shell” quests**
   - Pattern: `start -> instruction -> finish` with one gate and no branching.
   - Risk: feels transactional, low retention, easy to auto-generate but not meaningful.

2. **Checklist prose without in-game verification**
   - Long instruction text appears in one node, but there is little/no mechanic-level evidence that
     the player performed intermediate steps.

3. **Progress by accumulation only (numeric grind ladders)**
   - Especially visible in `energy/dWatt-*` style quests.
   - Risk: inflated goals with minimal narrative/mechanical variety.

4. **Generic rewards and weak differentiation**
   - Many quests grant the same trophy-like item regardless of topic/effort.
   - Risk: progression and domain identity blur together.

5. **Hardening metadata optimism without corresponding depth**
   - Some quests have high scores or pass markers while still structurally thin.
   - Risk: hardening fields become decorative instead of quality evidence.

6. **Terminology and identity drift**
   - Example: file path `electronics/soldering-intro.json` has ID `electronics/tin-soldering-iron`.
   - Risk: harder diagnostics, author confusion, and weaker canonical mapping.

## Problematic quests to prioritize (with improvement checklist)

Use this as an actionable backlog for quest polishing passes.

### 1) `astronomy/saturn-rings`

- [ ] Add at least one branch with meaningful outcomes (weather fallback, seeing conditions,
      alternative target).
- [ ] Add an evidence step (e.g., logged observation quality or sketch process output).
- [ ] Add explicit troubleshooting loop (focus drift, light pollution adaptation).

### 2) `devops/fail2ban`

- [ ] Split install/config/verify into separate gated steps.
- [ ] Add verification artifact process (e.g., parse ban logs, confirm jail status).
- [ ] Add safe rollback guidance to avoid lockout.

### 3) `energy/dWatt-1e8` (and sibling `dWatt-*`, `dSolar-*` ladder quests)

- [ ] Replace pure threshold gating with mixed goals (efficiency, uptime, storage strategy).
- [ ] Add at least one mechanics-backed checkpoint (`requiresItems`/`process` output proof)
      before final completion.
- [ ] Add at least one decision branch (invest vs conserve, automation vs manual).
- [ ] Normalize copy tone to avoid repetitive superlative inflation.

### 4) `electronics/soldering-intro` (file) / `electronics/tin-soldering-iron` (ID)

- [ ] Align file basename and quest ID for canonical clarity.
- [ ] Add an explicit quality check branch (cold joint detection, re-tinning step).
- [ ] Add process-backed verification before completion.

### 5) `woodworking/workbench`

- [ ] Add measurement/tolerance verification gate (level/square outcomes).
- [ ] Add mechanics-backed proof step (e.g., process log or required measuring tool item gate).
- [ ] Add branch for common recovery (racked frame, wobble correction).
- [ ] Replace one-shot grant/finish with a validated build checklist process.

### 6) `firstaid/treat-burn`

- [ ] Add triage branch (minor vs severe burn escalation).
- [ ] Gate completion on correct safe response sequence.
- [ ] Require evidence-backed step (e.g., correct kit item/process selection) before completion.
- [ ] Add misuse warnings (ice/direct ointment on severe burns, etc.).

### 7) `geothermal/calibrate-ground-sensor`

- [ ] Expand from single calibration step to baseline + verification + drift follow-up.
- [ ] Gate with logged before/after readings.
- [ ] Add fault branch (sensor out-of-range / replacement escalation).

### 8) `programming/web-server`

- [ ] Add explicit request/response validation and error branch.
- [ ] Add one observable artifact output (endpoint response snapshot, log excerpt).
- [ ] Connect reward to a downstream quest dependency with specific capability unlock.

## Documentation improvements needed for quest authoring

These improvements are meant for what humans/agents read right after `AGENTS.md` references prompt
docs.

### A) Add a “quality bar” section to quest prompts

Add hard requirements beyond schema validity:

- Minimum interaction depth expectation (or explicit rationale for short quests).
- At least one troubleshooting/recovery branch for technical quests.
- At least one mechanics-backed evidence gate (not only prose confirmation).
- Domain-specific safety/realism checks when applicable.

### B) Add anti-pattern lint guidance for prompt users

Authoring docs should explicitly call out and forbid common shallow patterns:

- “Three-node thin shell” quests unless intentionally marked as micro-quests.
- Pure accumulation ladders without strategic decisions.
- Hardening score inflation not backed by substantive quest revisions.

### C) Add a pre-commit self-review checklist for humans + LLMs

Before committing a quest update, require a short self-audit:

- What the player learns.
- What the player proves in mechanics.
- What can go wrong and how the quest handles it.
- Why reward and prerequisites are proportionate.

### D) Encourage pair updates for docs + quest changes

Quest updates should include companion updates to the tree’s Skills docs in
`frontend/src/pages/docs/md/<tree>.md`, documenting gate logic and QA notes.

## Definition of done for v3 quest quality hardening

- [ ] The prioritized problematic quest list above has owners and tracking issues.
- [ ] Quest prompt docs include anti-pattern guidance and a self-review checklist.
- [ ] QA checklist §4.5 checkboxes are updated as manual validation progresses.
- [ ] At least one representative quest in each major new tree is manually validated before release.
