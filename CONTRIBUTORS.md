# CONTRIBUTORS.md

## Welcome to the Contribution Guide!

Thank you for your interest in our project! We truly appreciate your willingness to contribute. This document provides a set of guidelines to facilitate your contribution process. Whether you're submitting a bug report, suggesting a new feature, or directly writing some code, we welcome your participation.

### 1. Getting Started

The project is licensed under the 0BSD license, which allows very permissive free use. This means you are allowed to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.

### 2. Where to Contribute

You're invited to contribute in several ways:

1. **Bug Reports:** If you encounter any bugs or issues while playing the game, please report them in the **[Issues](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace/issues)** section of our GitHub repository. Before creating a new issue, make sure to check if a similar issue hasn't been reported already. 

2. **Feature Requests:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement for our game, please also submit this to the **Issues** section. Be as detailed as possible to help us understand your suggestion. 

3. **Code Contributions:** If you'd like to write code to fix issues or add new features, we encourage you to do so. 

### 3. Good First Issues & Help Wanted

If you are new to the project, you may start with issues labelled as "Good First Issue". These issues are typically simpler and easier to resolve, and are a great way for new contributors to get involved with the project.

More experienced contributors can look for the "Help Wanted" label. These are issues or enhancements that are somewhat more involved than "Good First Issues".

### 4. Pull Requests

Once you're ready to submit your code, create a pull request on GitHub. This will initiate a review process of your code. Please provide as much detail as possible in your pull request description.

### 5. Coding Guidelines

We don't have a strict coding style guide (yet?), but we do ask that you keep your code clean and well-commented. Additionally, if you're able to add unit tests for your code, that would be great, but it's not required unless otherwise stated.

### 6. Contact

If you have any questions or need further clarification on anything, feel free to contact us through [Discord](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM). 

### 7. Acknowledgements

Every contribution to this project is valued. When your pull request is merged into the codebase, you'll be added to the list of contributors. We appreciate your time and effort.

Happy coding and exploring!
