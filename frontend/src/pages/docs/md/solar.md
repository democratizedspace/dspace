Solar power is a renewable energy source that has a number of benefits:

- Solar panels don't require moving parts (in most cases)
- Solar panels can be added incrementally
- Solar panels can be made with common materials

For this reason, it's the first major energy source supported by the game. Wind will also be added in the future, in addition to all the other power sources you might expect.
