DSPACE aims to make the creation and launches of rockets so easy that anyone can do it.

You'll eventually be able to build a fully functioning virtual rocket and launch it into space. This will be a major milestone for the game, as everything leading up to that seems very loosely related. The first person to launch a rocket into orbit in DSPACE will be able to claim a unique title for their account.

The ultimate goal is to make the creation of a functioning orbital rocket achievable in the real-world, too! There's no fundamental reason why this shouldn't be possible, but it will require a lot of work. It will also require complying with ITAR, which will be a challenge. This is a long-term goal, and it will take many years, if not decades.
