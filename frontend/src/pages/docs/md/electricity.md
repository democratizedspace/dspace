## Non-renewable energy

If you plug a machine in the wall (on Earth, at least), chances are you're still using fossil fuels, either from coal or natural gas. In DSPACE, there is a built-in carbon tax that is applied to all electricity usage based on fossil fuels. For every 1000 [dCarbon](/docs/dCarbon) produced within the game, your sell prices in the shop will be reduced by 1%. This provides a monetary incentive to continue to adopt renewable energy production.

## Renewable energy

You can buy a solar panel or handheld wind turbine from [Amazing](/docs/amazing). These will generate electricity for you, and you can use them to power your machines. You can also sell the electricity you generate to other players.
