## 1) Observe the Moon (`astronomy/observe-moon`)

- Quest link: [/quests/astronomy/observe-moon](/quests/astronomy/observe-moon)
- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `welcome/howtodoquests`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `start` → "Kit is staged and sunset has started." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
    - `record` → "Observation and sketch are complete." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
    - `verify` → "All three fields are complete and readable." — mission log entry ×1, basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `session-check` branches to either `record` for a safe observing window or `recovery` when conditions are unsafe.
    - `verify` enforces a complete observation artifact (time + crater notes + seeing note) before completion.
    - `recovery` requires capping optics and re-validating footing/light discipline before looping back.
- Grants:
    - Dialogue options/steps grantsItems: None
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None
- Rewards:
    - cured compost bucket ×1
- Processes used:

- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `start` → "I'm ready." — 50 mm magnifying lens ×1, 20 mm magnifying lens ×1, cardboard mailing tube ×1, camera tripod ×1, masking tape ×1
    - `build`/`alternate-build` → "Assembly complete; verify image quality." / "Staged build done; start verification." — basic telescope ×1
    - `verify` → "Verified: stable tripod and clear moon points logged." — mission log entry ×1, basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1

## QA flow notes

- Cross-quest dependencies: follow quest unlocks in order; each quest above lists exact `requiresQuests` and inventory gates that must be present before completion paths appear.
- Progression integrity checks: verify each process-backed step can be completed either by running the process or by satisfying the documented continuation gate items.
- Known pitfalls: repeated processes may generate stackable logs or outputs; validate minimum item counts on continuation options before skipping process steps.
