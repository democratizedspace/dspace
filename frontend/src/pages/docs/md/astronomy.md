## 1) Observe the Moon (`astronomy/observe-moon`)

- Quest link: [/quests/astronomy/observe-moon](/quests/astronomy/observe-moon)
- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `welcome/howtodoquests`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `start` → "Kit is staged and sunset has started." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
    - `record` → "Observation and sketch are complete." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
    - `verify` → "All three fields are complete and readable." — mission log entry ×1, basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `session-check` branches to either `record` for a safe observing window or `recovery` when conditions are unsafe.
    - `verify` enforces a complete observation artifact (time + crater notes + seeing note) before completion.
    - `recovery` requires capping optics and re-validating footing/light discipline before looping back.
- Grants:
    - Dialogue options/steps grantsItems: moon crater sketch sheet ×1 (granted in `finish` via “Record and archive…” option)
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None
- Rewards:

- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `build` branches into a direct assembly path and an alternate staged pre-mount path before verification.
    - `verify` now gates advancement on the mission log entry artifact from `write-mission-log-entry` before safety sign-off.
    - `verify-safety` adds a hard safety gate (lens cap + fault scan + no sun alignment) and routes faults to `troubleshoot` before finish.

- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `choose-observation-mode` adds a non-linear branch between full station setup and a naked-eye fallback lane.
    - `weather-delay` can schedule a deferred follow-up window (`follow-up-window`) when no safe viewing window exists.
    - `interpret` enforces a complete observation artifact (time + direction + duration) and routes incomplete entries back to mode selection for deterministic retries.

    - `capture` → "Photo saved and metadata logged." — mission logbook ×1, ISS pass window ×1, mission log entry ×1, feather quill ×1
    - `interpret` → "Pass: streak continuous, timing <15s, heading matches plan." — mission logbook ×1, mission log entry ×1, feather quill ×1, iss long-exposure photo print ×1
    - `recovery` → "Session aborted safely; follow-up logged for next pass." — mission log entry ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:

    - `recovery` → "Unsafe tonight, but evidence is already logged—finish with caution." — mission logbook ×1, mission log entry ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `plan` branches to `chart-route` (main) and `quick-route` (alternate) before evidence review.
    - `recovery` enforces safety stand-down for unsafe footing/weather/glare and loops back to planning.
    - `interpret` blocks completion when evidence is inconsistent and routes back through recovery.

    - `log-evidence` → "Logged with conditions and constellation list." — mission logbook ×1, constellation sketch set ×1, mission log entry ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `choose-route` creates main and alternate mapping paths before charting.
    - `plan-route`, `sweep-route`, and `chart` all branch to `recovery` for haze/glare disorientation.
    - `recovery` loops back to route selection after a safety reset and prevents completion bypasses.
- Grants:

    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None
- Rewards:
    - planisphere star chart ×1

    - `interpret` → "Yes—color contrast and repeatability are both confirmed." — mission log entry ×1, mission logbook ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `choose-route` now requires both evidence capture and an explicit interpretation gate before completion.
    - `recovery` loops back to route selection after tripod/footing/glare safety checks.
    - Unsafe conditions can still finish only through a caution path, preserving fail-closed safety behavior.
- Grants:

- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `choose-site` provides a main path and alternate darker-site path before interpretation.
    - `recovery` enforces glare/haze/footing safety pauses and explicit abort-or-retry handling.
    - Safety abort completion requires a mission-log entry describing why the run was skipped.

    - `log-track` → "Track logged with timestamp and star references." — mission logbook ×1, mission log entry ×1, feather quill ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `choose-route` introduces main and alternate setup paths before log evidence.
    - `recovery` enforces dark-path footing and glare safety checks with retry or safe-reschedule exits.
    - Safe-reschedule completion requires existing mission-log evidence, preventing bypass of the comet track record gate.

    - `interpret` → "Yes—logged order is consistent and uncertainty is documented." — mission log entry ×1, basic telescope ×1
    - `recovery` → "Unsafe window tonight; finish with a logged caution note." — mission log entry ×1
- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `plan` now branches to a chart-first main route and a quick-confirm alternate route.

- Troubleshooting/safety branches:
    - `setup` now branches between full-length captures and `interval-plan` burst strategy when seeing is unstable.
    - Both capture strategies gate advancement through `capture-star-trail-stack` evidence before interpretation.
    - `setup` can route to `recovery` on condensation/cloud/battery failures.

    - `interpret` → "Measured fraction is within the 20%-60% target band." — Venus phase sketch ×1
- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `view` now branches to `recheck` when seeing is unstable.
    - `interpret` enforces pass/fail bounds (20%-60% illuminated fraction) and routes out-of-range results to corrective re-test loops (`recheck` → `plan`/`view`).
    - `recheck` archives failed evidence with `reset-venus-phase-sketch` before retesting to keep final proof deterministic.

## QA flow notes

- Cross-quest dependencies: follow quest unlocks in order; each quest above lists exact `requiresQuests` and inventory gates that must be present before completion paths appear.
- Progression integrity checks: verify each process-backed step can be completed either by running the process or by satisfying the documented continuation gate items.
- Known pitfalls: repeated processes may generate stackable logs or outputs; validate minimum item counts on continuation options before skipping process steps.
