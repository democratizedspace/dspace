- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `welcome/howtodoquests`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `start` → "Kit is staged and sunset has started." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1
    - `record` → "Observation and sketch are complete." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1, feather quill ×1, bottle of black ink ×1, red flashlight ×1

- Quest link: [/quests/astronomy/star-trails](/quests/astronomy/star-trails)
- Unlock prerequisite:

- Grants:
    - Dialogue options/steps grantsItems: None
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None
- Rewards:
    - cured compost bucket ×1
- Processes used:
    - [draft-seasonal-star-plan](/processes/draft-seasonal-star-plan)
        - Requires: planisphere star chart ×1, red flashlight ×1, mission logbook ×1
        - Consumes: none

## 20) Sketch Sunspots (`astronomy/sunspot-sketch`)

- Quest link: [/quests/astronomy/sunspot-sketch](/quests/astronomy/sunspot-sketch)
- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `astronomy/saturn-rings`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `project` → "Sunspots sketched in my logbook." — basic telescope ×1, mission logbook ×1
- Grants:
    - Dialogue options/steps grantsItems: None
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None

## 21) Observe Venus's Phases (`astronomy/venus-phases`)

- Quest link: [/quests/astronomy/venus-phases](/quests/astronomy/venus-phases)
- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `astronomy/saturn-rings`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:
    - `start` → "Ready to aim." — planisphere star chart ×1, basic telescope ×1
    - `plan` → "Timing locked—let's observe." — Venus observation window ×1
    - `view` → "Phase recorded with date and time." — Venus phase sketch ×1
    - `interpret` → "Measured fraction is within the 20%-60% target band." — Venus phase sketch ×1
- Troubleshooting and safety flow:
    - `view` now branches to `recheck` when seeing is unstable.
    - `interpret` enforces pass/fail bounds (20%-60% illuminated fraction) and routes out-of-range results to corrective re-test loops (`recheck` → `plan`/`view`).
    - `recheck` archives failed evidence with `reset-venus-phase-sketch` before retesting to keep final proof deterministic.
- Grants:
    - Dialogue options/steps grantsItems: None
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None
- Rewards:
    - Venus phase sketch ×1
- Processes used:
    - [plan-venus-window](/processes/plan-venus-window)
        - Requires: planisphere star chart ×1, smartphone ×1, mission logbook ×1

## QA flow notes

- Cross-quest dependencies: follow quest unlocks in order; each quest above lists exact `requiresQuests` and inventory gates that must be present before completion paths appear.
- Progression integrity checks: verify each process-backed step can be completed either by running the process or by satisfying the documented continuation gate items.
- Known pitfalls: repeated processes may generate stackable logs or outputs; validate minimum item counts on continuation options before skipping process steps.
