[Hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) is the process of growing plants in a water-based nutrient solution.

Hydroponics is a great way to grow plants in space or on bodies like the Moon or Mars. You can grow them in a carefully controlled environment, and you don't have to worry about soil or other things that might be difficult or expensive to transport.
