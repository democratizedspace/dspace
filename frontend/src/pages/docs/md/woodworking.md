## 1) Build a Planter Box (`woodworking/planter-box`)

- Quest link: [/quests/woodworking/planter-box](/quests/woodworking/planter-box)
- Unlock prerequisite:
    - `requiresQuests`: `welcome/howtodoquests`
- Dialogue `requiresItems` gates:

    - `build` → "Assembly done, move to liner check" — Pine planter box ×1
    - `seal` → "Drainage and stability verified" — Pine planter box ×1
- Grants:
    - `gather` → "Gather materials" — claw hammer (16 oz) ×1
    - Quest-level `grantsItems`: None

## QA flow notes

- Cross-quest dependencies: follow quest unlocks in order; each quest above lists exact `requiresQuests` and inventory gates that must be present before completion paths appear.
- Progression integrity checks: verify each process-backed step can be completed either by running the process or by satisfying the documented continuation gate items.
- Known pitfalls: repeated processes may generate stackable logs or outputs; validate minimum item counts on continuation options before skipping process steps.
