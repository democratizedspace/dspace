At v1, everything in the game will be real-time.

If a [3d print](/docs/3dprinting) (or any other machine or [process](/docs/processes)) takes 1 hour in the real world, it will take 1 hour in the game. Flying to Mars with traditional propulsive rockets will take a whole 5 months at first!

By slowing things down to real-time, we force players to make critical decisions about what they want to do and plan accordingly. It also makes the game more accessible to people who don't have a lot of time to play, as they can set and forget some long-running process.
