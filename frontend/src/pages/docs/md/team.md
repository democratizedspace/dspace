ChatGPT is a computer program that has been trained to understand and generate human-like text. It was created by OpenAI and is capable of answering questions, completing tasks, and even generating creative content like stories and poems. ChatGPT can interact with people in a conversational manner and is often used for things like customer service, personal assistants, and more.

DALL-E is an AI system that has been trained to generate original images from textual descriptions. It was developed by OpenAI and can create diverse and imaginative pictures from just a few words. For example, if you asked DALL-E to '[create an image of a toaster riding a bicycle](/assets/changelog/20230131/toaster.jpg)', it would generate an entirely new image of exactly that! DALL-E's ability to generate unique and creative images makes it useful for fields such as advertising, product design, and more.

Scenario is a generative model web app that allows users to train AI models to create specific objects and styles. With an easy-to-use interface, users can upload their own data and train models to generate outputs that match their desired styles and objects. For example, if you wanted to train a model to generate different variations of cats, you could upload pictures of cats and fine-tune the model until it generates new, original images of cats that match the styles and characteristics you want. The versatility of Scenario makes it a useful tool for artists, designers, and anyone looking to generate unique and custom outputs.
