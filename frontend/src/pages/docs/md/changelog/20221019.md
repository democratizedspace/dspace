- Overhauled the [Inventory](/inventory) and [Quests](/quests) pages.
- You can now manually create any of the items on the item page (e.g. [/inventory/1](/inventory/1)).
- Set cooldowns for all [items](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/inventory/json/items.json). If cooldown is not specified, default to 5 minutes.
- You can now finish the [first 3D printing quest](/quests/play/0) and collect your reward.
- Material and machine requirements don't apply yet but will in the future.
- Path for quests is now `/quests/play/\[id\]` instead of `/quests/\[id\]` (e.g. [/quests/play/0](/quests/play/0)).
