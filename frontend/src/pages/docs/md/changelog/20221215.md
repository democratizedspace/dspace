#### Bugfixes

- The itemlist components are now more compact, and we've changed the hover effect based on [user feedback](https://twitter.com/EspToTheFuture/status/1602454191322136576).
- TODO(finish the big number suffix implementation) the Item counts sometimes overflowed the containers they're in. We now limit the number of digits after the decimal point to address this.

#### Menubar

- Removed currently unused items from the top menu to reduce confusion. They'll gradually be added back over time as each feature is implemented. These items were removed:
  - Guilds
  - Shop
  - Profile
  - Stats
  - Achievements
  - Leaderboard
- All of the removed items have been added to the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) to make sure they're tracked and implemented.
