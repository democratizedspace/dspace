#### Bugfixes

- TODO: Previously, you could accidentally overcommit on materials when completing processes. We've added new features to help manage the process:
    - Processes now have an explicit lifecycle managed by Start, Cancel, and Finish actions.
    - These actions help reserve materials for the process and allow the user to cancel the process if they change their mind.
    - When the process is completed, the user is rewarded with the output items.
- The itemlist components are now more compact, and we've changed the hover effect based on [user feedback](https://twitter.com/EspToTheFuture/status/1602454191322136576).
- Item counts sometimes overflowed the containers they're in. We now limit the number of digits after the decimal point to address this.
