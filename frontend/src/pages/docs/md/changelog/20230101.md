New year, new content update!

- [Print and launch](/quests/play/1) your own model rocket.
- Grow hydroponic [basil](/quests/play/2) and harvest it for profit.
- Generate [dWatt](/inventory/item/22) sustainably with solar and wind power to avoid accruing [dCarbon](/docs/dCarbon).

I'm working on some [big important changes](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace/pull/19) behind the scenes that will fix some of the awkwardness of quests and help me scale the amount of content I add greatly. In the meantime, I'll try adding a few more quests here and there. New features and non-critical bugfixes are on pause right now until those big changes are implemented. Stay tuned!

## Known issues

- Currently, when you start a [process](/docs/processes), it won't reserve the materials, which means you can accidentally overcommit if you end up selling or using those materials somewhere else. The fix for this is not trivial, and it's what prompted the cookies->localStorage change in the first place. Once that change is done, items that are consumed will be consumed when you start the process. Expect that change before the end of Q1 2023. As a workaround, make sure you have an abundant amount of materials before starting a process.
