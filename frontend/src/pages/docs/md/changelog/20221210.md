#### Quests

- Added some unique collectibles for obtaining the following items:
  - [Benchy](/inventory/item/1)
  - [3d printed model rocket](/inventory/item/11)
  - [Edison Model M](/inventory/item/4)
- Added more content to the [hydroponics quest](/quests/play/2). You can now germinate seeds to produce seedlings!

#### Energy

- With a handy [smart plug](/inventory/item/29), you can tokenize energy usage before it's used in order to track the amount of CO2 emissions. Generating [dWatt](/inventory/item/22) using your wall outlet assumes the energy source is coal, which means you'll also generate [dCarbon](/inventory/item/20), a tokenized representation of 1 kg of CO2 emissions.
- In the future, you'll be able to generate dWatt using [solar panels](/inventory/item/5) and (wind turbines)[/inventory/item/7], which will not generate dCarbon.
- In a future update, you'll be able to burn dCarbon by paying with [dUSD](/inventory/item/24). As you accrue dCarbon in your inventory, you'll incur penalties on your account to incentivize renewables.

#### Machines and Processes

- The complicated series of steps needed to 3D print a [Benchy](/inventory/item/1) is now replaced by a simplified machine and [process](/docs/processes) system. Processes have a total duration (anything from a few seconds to many days) that must elapse before you can exchange a list of items for a list of other items, and they may require a certain machine in order to work. Go through the quests to learn more about processes!
