- You can now create a test print in the [3D Printing quest](/quests/0)! No material requirements just yet, so you can create as many test prints as you want!

- Friendly reminder that there's a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM), and that you can see all the code for this site on [Github](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace)!
