What's DSPACE, you ask? You must be new around here, and if so, welcome!!! I'm glad you're here. DSPACE is a space exploration game that I've been working on for a while now. It's still in its early stages, but I'm excited to share it with you. You can learn more about the game on the [About](/docs/about) page.

## New quests

Do you like grindy quests? If so, you're in luck! You'll notice some new quests that reward you for grinding out some prints on your 3D printer, generating energy, and soaking up the sun's rays with your solar panels.

In total, v2.1 adds 11 new quests. These will take a while, but it gives the hardcore players a little something extra to work on. v2.2 brings a ton of new quests, including the non-grindy kind! I'm hoping to accommodate a variety of preferences when it comes to gameplay.

## Gamesave import/export

DSPACE will eventually have cloud saves, but for now, in order to maximize user privacy and simplify the architecture, all of game state is stored in localStorage ([the nerdy details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) if you're into that sort of thing).

In the short term, you can now export your game state on the [gamesaves](/gamesaves) page. It's pretty barebones at the moment, but it gets the job done! Just chuck that block of text in a notes app or a discord server.

## Reliability improvements and code health improvements

This is a pretty minor update content-wise, but this update also adds a lot of important code, like instructions on what meta tags to inject in the HTML pages for SEO purposes. Additionally, game state related code has significantly increased test coverage. This is all in [preparation](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) for finding incentives (e.g. bounties) for third-party contributors
