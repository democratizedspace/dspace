## Major updates

### Revamped Quest System

</figure>

Elevating your questing experience is my top priority. I've added engaging NPCs, branching dialogues, and more to make your journey exciting and immersive. Although the dialogues are linear for now, I've built a robust, expandable quest system which I'll continue to evolve in future updates!

In the process of this revamp, I've removed some older quests and rearranged others. So, if you're a returning player from DSPACE v1, you may find some of the content familiar. I've made the tough call to reset everyone's quest progress, but don't worry! All the items you've collected are still safely stored in your inventory. Plus, the updated quests now yield even better rewards.

In upcoming versions, I'll be leveraging large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to enable you to ask open-ended questions to NPCs. They'll respond with a deep understanding of the game and its systems. We'll be inching towards this goal incrementally, so stay tuned!

Check out the new quests on the [Quests](/quests) page.

### Improved processes

I've worked on making [Processes](/docs/processes) more intuitive and visually pleasing. You can now interact with quests directly on the quest page. Experience the enhanced processes for yourself!

### Searchable, filterable inventory

<figure>

</figure>

Your inventory now features a handy search bar, doing away with the need for Ctrl+F or endless scrolling. Just type in anything related to the item - be it a part of the name, description, or even the price, if you happen to remember it.

And now, instead of displaying every item in the game, your inventory only shows what you actually own (with the option to view all items if you so choose). Item filters are also on the horizon! If you're keen to have this feature sooner, please upvote [this issue](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace/issues/36)!

### Customizable Avatars

I'm setting the stage for a social multiplayer experience in the future. To kick things off, you can now choose your own avatar from a range of options, with more coming down the line. Visit the [Profile](/profile) page to pick your avatar!

### Updated Documentation

<figure>

I believe that good documentation is vital, and I'm striving to ensure that DSPACE has the best docs out there! If you're eager to learn more about the game, check out the freshly updated [Docs](/docs) page.

## Experimental Features

I'm also working on a few experimental features, which you might find interesting, although they're not quite ready for full-fledged use:

### dChat

</figure>

Jumping on the AI Chat app trend, I've introduced my own version called dChat. It's a work in progress and may have a few bugs, but I'm continually improving it. While it doesn't know much about the game yet, that's changing soon!

### Ethereum Wallet Integration

<figure>

</figure>

For those interested in blockchains, I'm working on integrating Ethereum wallet functionality. You can sign in with your wallet on the [Wallet](/wallet) page, with more features to be gradually rolled out. I assure you that this won't be mandatory, and you'll be able to enjoy the game without it.
