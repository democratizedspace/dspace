In the future, DSPACE will support an organizational structure called a guild. Guilds will be able to self-organize and accomplish things in the game more effectively through economies of scale and collaboration.

One of the core functions of a guild will be definining jobs and bounties and assigning them to members. This will allow guilds to create a more efficient workflow for accomplishing tasks.
