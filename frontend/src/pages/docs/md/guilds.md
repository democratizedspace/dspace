In the future, DSPACE will support an organizational structure called a guild. Guilds will be able to self-organize and accomplish things in the game more effectively through economies of scale and collaboration. To create a guild, you must mint a token for your guild tag (e.g. [M]) and choose a guild name.

One of the core functions of a guild will be definining jobs and bounties and assigning them to members. This will allow guilds to create a more efficient workflow for accomplishing tasks.

Holding a guild tag may cost a small recurring fee to discourage squatters and collect revenue for the rest of the community for distribution through UBI systems. The guild tags will be tokenized as NFTs, so they can be sold or traded. No developer or platform fees will be collected.
