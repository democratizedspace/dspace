dWatt is a token that represents 1 Watt of power.

In order to perform any [process](/docs/processes), you must have enough dWatt to power the process. To generate dWatt, see the [Energy](/energy) page.

Generating dWatt using an outlet assumes the use of fossil fuels, so it also causes you to accrue [dCarbon](/docs/dCarbon). To avoid accruing dCarbon, you can generate dWatt using renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines.
