- **Unstoppable**: the protocol cannot be stopped by anyone. It runs for as long as the underlying blockchain exists.
- **Free**: there is a 0% protocol wide fee and runs exactly at gas cost.
- **Valuable**: accrues value which is accessible and exitable by the owners.
- **Expansive**: there are built-in incentives for participants in the protocol.
- **Permissionless**: universally accessible and censorship resistant. Builders and users cannot be deplatformed.
- **Positive sum**: it creates a win-win environment for participants to utilize the same infrastrastructure.
- **Credibly neutral**: the protocol is user-agnostic.

These are the principles laid out [here](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures). They are the criteria that a protocol must meet to be considered a hyperstructure.

## In DSPACE

In DSPACE, we have a few hyperstructures that we are building, and they take the form of smart contracts. They are:

- [Amazing](/docs/amazing), our item/resource shop that takes no platform fees and distributes incoming revenue right back to the community
- a smart contract that allows developers, scientists, and creators to monetize their contributions to the DSPACE ecosystem by accepting donations for their work
- The Metaguild [M], a guild that pays developers, scientists, and creators to work on DSPACE projects, adding new game mechanics and features to the DSPACE ecosystem
