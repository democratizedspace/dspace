## What can I do?

You can currently create any item in your [inventory](/inventory) as long as it is not on cooldown! Eventually it will require raw materials, which must be extracted (i.e. mined) or purchased from [Amazing](/docs/amazing). 

## Where can I learn more?

On the [Discord](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM)!
