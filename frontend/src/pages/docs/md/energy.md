## QA flow notes

- Cross-quest dependencies: follow quest unlocks in order; each quest above lists exact `requiresQuests` and inventory gates that must be present before completion paths appear.
- Progression integrity checks: verify each process-backed step can be completed either by running the process or by satisfying the documented continuation gate items.
- Known pitfalls: repeated processes may generate stackable logs or outputs; validate minimum item counts on continuation options before skipping process steps.
