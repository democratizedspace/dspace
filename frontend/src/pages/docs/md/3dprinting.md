3D printing is the process of making a three-dimensional object from a digital file. The object is created by laying down many thin layers of material in succession.

## Why 3D printing?

3D printing is a great way to make prototypes or things that would otherwise require much larger machines.

In space, specifically, 3D printing is crucial for making things like tools, spare parts, and other things that are very situational or difficult to plan for. They could also be scaled up substantially to make things like habitats or space stations. You could also 3D print entire human organs in low earth orbit and send them down to Earth.
