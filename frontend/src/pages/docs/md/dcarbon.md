dCarbon is the in-game equivalent of 1 metric ton of carbon. It is accrued whenever you use electricity based on fossil fuels. In practice, that translates to around 433 kilograms per MWh of usage. For every 1000 dCarbon produced within the game, your sell prices in the shop will be reduced by 1%. This provides a monetary incentive to adopt renewable energy production.
