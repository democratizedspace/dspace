dCarbon is a token that represents the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a player. 1 dCarbon = 1 kg of carbon dioxide.

In a future update, there will be a penalty applied when selling items, depending on the amount of dCarbon the user has. The amount of dCarbon an account has can only be reduced by contributing [dUSD](/docs/dUSD) to a carbon fund that helps* other players obtain items to generate renewable energy, like solar panels, wind turbines, or batteries.

\* In the local, singleplayer experience, this is just a dUSD sink. In the multiplayer experience (powered by smart contracts on a blockchain), dCarbon will be a real token used to help other actual players in their quest to reduce their own carbon footprint.

Exact numbers are still being worked out, so stay tuned!
