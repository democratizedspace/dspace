DSPACE is an incremental simulation game about resource management and space exploration. In the game, you will learn skills, work on [quests](/quests), and build your own presence in the solar system. 

**The game is still very much under development. The following is an imagined future iteration of the game and does not represent the current state.** If you would like to get involved in the creation of the game, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/A3UAfYvnxM) and say hello!

## Start with the basics

Learn skills related to space exploration and resource management, and be an early adopter of (virtual) futuristic tech.

## Gain momentum

Find a career related to the manufacturing of rockets, satellites, solar panels, and other space-related equipment. Or maybe you want to start a mining operation, or be a space pirate, or a space tourist. The choice is yours! Gain access to an existing launch provider or use your own rockets. Launch payloads into low Earth orbit. Create fuel depots. Explore the moon and beyond. Build your own space station.

## Research

Use in-situ resource utilization. Mine the moon for water and oxygen. Use the water and oxygen to produce rocket fuel. Use the rocket fuel to launch rockets. Use the rockets to launch more rockets. Master the Sabatier reaction on Mars to generate fuel.

## Make your own quests

Make your [quests](/quests) locally and then share them with the community.
