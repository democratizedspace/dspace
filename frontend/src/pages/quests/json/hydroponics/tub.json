It's a great way to save resources and space while ensuring a constant supply of fresh produce during your space adventures. Unless you're growing outside, you'll definitely incur a bit of energy costs from indoor lighting, but on the flip side you can save up to 95% on your water usage compared to traditional farming. I've got a hydroponics tub for you to get started if you're interested.",
